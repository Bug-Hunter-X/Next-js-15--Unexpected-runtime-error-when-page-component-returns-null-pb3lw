# Next.js 15: Null Return from Page Component

This repository demonstrates an uncommon error in Next.js 15 where returning `null` from a page component results in a runtime error.  In many React applications, returning `null` conditionally is acceptable practice; however, in Next.js 15, the page component must always return a valid JSX element or fragment, even if it's empty (e.g., `<></>`). 

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm run dev`.
4. Navigate to `/about`.
5. Observe the runtime error in the console.

## Solution

The solution is to ensure that your page component always returns valid JSX. If you need to conditionally render nothing, return an empty JSX fragment: `<> </>`.
